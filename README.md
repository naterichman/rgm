# RGM

Basic Git manager for multiple git projects inspired by
[gfold](https://github.com/nickgerace/gfold)

The goal of RGM is to be a git manager for _many_ git repos.  In my work, I have many
(~150) git repo's that I frequent.  I tried out 
[gfold](https://github.com/nickgerace/gfold) which is really an awesome idea, but it
didn't really do what I wanted it to.

What I really want is something that allows me to easily list, search, and enter the git
directory I'm currently working in, while also being performant.

This is also meant to be a project for me to learn rust, I'm tracking development status
with #1
